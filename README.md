# Artificial-Visionary-Network

These days, everyone is aware of and accustomed to digital environments and automation. Images are produced in stimulating surroundings, ranging from amusement movies to video games. An artificial three-dimensional (3-D) visual environment or other sensory environment that may be interacted with by means of a computer, with realistic-looking scenes and objects.  

With the use of virtual reality (VR) technology, users can entirely lose themselves in a digital world and ignore the real world. Usually, it entails donning a headgear that monitors head motions and projects a 360-degree virtual world. It is among the popular entertainment genres that are expanding in today's world. 

The developed model has several advantages like: 

Realistic Data Generation 

Diverse Output 

No Explicit Likelihood Function  

Style Transfer and Manipulation 

Easy to adapt & integrate with application 

Optimized modeling  

# Dependencies

Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/

Install pytorch at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

Install dependencies:

python -m pip install tqdm pillow numpy matplotlib opencv-python

For predicting videos you will also need ffmpeg

The model has been developed using Pytorch & scripted in Python. VsCode is the editor used for the scripting.
